# Best practices for successful prototypes

Flowbite is an open-source library of UI components built with the utility-first classes from Tailwind CSS. It also includes interactive elements such as dropdowns, modals, datepickers.

Before going digital, you might benefit from scribbling down some ideas in a sketchbook. This way, you can think things through before committing to an actual design project.

But then I found a [component library based on Tailwind CSS called Flowbite](https://flowbite.com). It comes with the most commonly used UI components, such as buttons, navigation bars, cards, form elements, and more which are conveniently built with the utility classes from Tailwind CSS.

## Getting started with Flowbite

First of all you need to understand how Flowbite works. This library is not another framework. Rather, it is a set of components based on Tailwind CSS that you can just copy-paste from the documentation.

It also includes a JavaScript file that enables interactive components, such as modals, dropdowns, and datepickers which you can optionally include into your project via CDN or NPM.

You can check out the [quickstart guide](https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart/) to explore the elements by including the CDN files into your project. But if you want to build a project with Flowbite I recommend you to follow the build tools steps so that you can purge and minify the generated CSS.

You'll also receive a lot of useful application UI, marketing UI, and e-commerce pages that can help you get started with your projects even faster. You can check out this [comparison table](https://flowbite.com/docs/components/tables/) to better understand the differences between the open-source and pro version of Flowbite.

## When does design come in handy?

While it might seem like extra work at a first glance, here are some key moments in which prototyping will come in handy:

1. **Usability testing**. Does your user know how to exit out of screens? Can they follow your intended user journey and buy something from the site you’ve designed? By running a usability test, you’ll be able to see how users will interact with your design once it’s live;
2. **Involving stakeholders**. Need to check if your GDPR consent boxes are displaying properly? Pass your prototype to your data protection team and they can test it for real;
3. **Impressing a client**. Prototypes can help explain or even sell your idea by providing your client with a hands-on experience;
4. **Communicating your vision**. By using an interactive medium to preview and test design elements, designers and developers can understand each other — and the project — better.

### Laying the groundwork for best design

Let's start by including the CSS file inside the <head> tag of your HTML.

### Understanding typography

#### Type properties

A typeface is a collection of letters. While each letter is unique, certain shapes are shared across letters. A typeface represents shared patterns across a collection of letters.

### Type classification

#### Serif

A serif is a small shape or projection that appears at the beginning or end of a stroke on a letter. Typefaces with serifs are called serif typefaces. Serif fonts are classified as one of the following:

#### Old-Style serifs

- Low contrast between thick and thin strokes
- Diagonal stress in the strokes
- Slanted serifs on lower-case ascenders

### Best practices for setting up your prototype

**Low fidelity or high fidelity?** Fidelity refers to how close a prototype will be to the real deal. If you’re simply preparing a quick visual aid for a presentation, a low-fidelity prototype — like a wireframe with placeholder images and some basic text — would be more than enough. But if you’re going for more intricate usability testing, a high-fidelity prototype — with on-brand colors, fonts and imagery — could help get more pointed results.

**Consider your user.** To create an intuitive user flow, try to think as your user would when interacting with your product. While you can fine-tune this during beta testing, considering your user’s needs and habits early on will save you time by setting you on the right path.

**Start from the inside out.** A nice way to both organize your tasks and create more user-friendly prototypes is by building your prototypes ‘inside out’. Start by focusing on what will be important to your user, like a Buy now button or an image gallery, and list each element by order of priority. This way, you’ll be able to create a prototype that puts your users’ needs at the heart of your design.

And there you have it! Everything you need to design and share prototypes — right in Flowbite Figma.
